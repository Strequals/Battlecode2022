This is our repo for our Battlecode 2022 bots! The folder trex2 contains our final submission (I think). Thanks to Malott Fat Cats (Battlecode 2021) for pathfinding code (https://github.com/IvanGeffner/battlecode2021/blob/master/thirtyone/BFSMuckraker.java).

Fork (Brian Wang) and Strequals (Andrew Zhang)
